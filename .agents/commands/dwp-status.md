description: Report status of a deep work plan without executing (provided by the installed `deepworkplan` skill)

# /dwp-status — provided by the `deepworkplan` skill

> Thin alias. The flow lives in the installed `deepworkplan` skill — this file

## What to do

Route this invocation to the **status** sub-skill of the installed `deepworkplan`
skill and follow it: read `.agents/skills/deepworkplan/status/SKILL.md` and execute
its flow. Plan and draft outputs land in this repo's gitignored `.dwp/`
(`.dwp/plans/`, `.dwp/drafts/`).

> Other agents: invoke the skill's `deepworkplan-status` sub-skill directly
> (`/deepworkplan-status` in Claude Code, `#deepworkplan-status` elsewhere). This
> `dwp-status` file is the shorter, conventional alias.
